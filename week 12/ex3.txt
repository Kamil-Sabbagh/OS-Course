for the size of 10M 
 DBUF: 10  bytes ----> sys0m1.620s
 DBUF: 100 bytes ----> sys0m0.194s
 DBUF: 512 bytes ----> sys0m0.043s

for the size of 100M
 DBUF: 10  bytes   -> sys0m16.641s
 DBUF: 100 bytes   -> sys0m1.852s
 DBUF: 512 bytes   -> sys0m0.487s 



first we notice that if we increase  the buffer the time for copying will decrease.
and decrease buffer size the time for copying will decrease.
also if we add O_SYNC parameter then the Input/output will becomes synchronous, the copy time will increases and will get much bigger 
finally we do the same as in 1 with O_SYNC ,the time will act the same as when without O_SYNC, even though the time it takes to copy will increase to greater values then before.
it makes huge difference for speed, especially with small buffers.
