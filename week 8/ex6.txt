/*
A machine has 16-bit virtual addresses. Pages
are 8 KB. How many entries are needed for a
single-level linear page table ? 
*/

single page size = 8 kb = 8 * 1024 = 2 ^ 13 B
offset size  = log(2 ^ 13 ) ( with base 2 ) = 13 bits 
number of the virtual pages = ( 2 ^ 16 ) / ( 2 ^ 13 )  = 2 ^ 3 = 8 pages 
therefoe we will need 8 entries
