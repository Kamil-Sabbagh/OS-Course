1)If we will increase buffer, time for copying will decrease. in opposite way it will increase by decreasing buffer size


2)If we will add O_SYNC parameter, then our I/O becomes synchronous => copy time increases


3)If we will do the same as in 1 with O_SYNC  we can see that the time will act the same as when without O_SYNC, though the time it takes to copy will increase to greater values then before.
