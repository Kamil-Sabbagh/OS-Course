first we notice that if we increase  the buffer the time for copying will decrease.
and decrease buffer size the time for copying will decrease.

also if we add O_SYNC parameter then the Input/output will becomes synchronous ( i.e. copy time will increases )

finally we do the same as in 1 with O_SYNC ,the time will act the same as when without O_SYNC, even though the time it takes to copy will increase to greater values then before.
